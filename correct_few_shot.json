It cannot be the left end, as G is at pos 3. So, the White house is at the right end (pos 7).\n3. Two houses are between White (7) and Blue. This places the Blue house at position 4. This is a contradiction, as Red is at position 4. Let's re-read. Ah, 'Green house is third from the left'. So: _ _ G _ _ _ _.\n4. The Red house is to its immediate right: _ _ G R _ _ _.\n5.

The G-R block cannot be next to Blue. The only place it fits is pos 1-2 or pos 6-7. In our current structure, it must be pos 6-7. The order becomes: [Pink] [Yellow] B Blue _ G R. This doesn't work. The only way is: [Yellow] [Pink] B Blue G R [White]. No, the G-R block must go in pos 1-2. So: G R B Blue _ _ _. White must be at the right end. G R B Blue _ _ W. The last two are Pink and Yellow.

Analyze C's statement: 'I am a Knave.' A Knight cannot say this (it's a lie). A Knave cannot say this either (it would be the truth).
