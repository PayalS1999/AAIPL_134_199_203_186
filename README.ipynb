The correct pattern is n^3 + n for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. For n = 6: 6^3 + 6 = 216 + 6 = 222. Still not matching. Let's re-express: The terms are 2, 12, 36, 80, 150. These can be expressed as 1^3 + 1, 2^3 + 4, 3^3 + 9, 4^3 + 16, 5^3 + 25. The added numbers are squares of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So for n = 6: 6^3 + 36 = 216 + 36 = 252.\"\n",

However, if we re-evaluate the pattern, we can notice that each term is increasing by consecutive increments of 10, 20, 40, 70. The next increment should be 140, but since this is not available, we can try adding 140 to the last term (150) and subtracting the next available increment (70) to get 80, and then add 70 to 80 to get 150, and then add 140 to 150 to get 290. However, the correct pattern is obtained by adding 10, 20, 40, 70, and then 140, but the next available increment after 150 is 210.

      "{'answer': 'A', 'reasoning': 'The given series appears to be formed by adding 10, then 20, then 40, then 70, which are doubling the increments. Following this pattern, the next increment should be 140. Adding 140 to 150 results in 290, but this is not an option. However, if we re-evaluate the pattern, we can notice that each term is increasing by consecutive increments of 10, 20, 40, 70. The next increment should be 140, but since this is not available, we can try adding 140 to the last term (150) and subtracting the next available increment (70) to get 80, and then add 70 to 80 to get 150, and then add 140 to 150 to get 290. However, the correct pattern is obtained by adding 10, 20, 40, 70, and then 140, but the next available increment after 150 is 210. So, the correct next term is 150 + 210 = 360, but this is not an option. However, if we re-evaluate the series again, we can notice that the series can be represented as 2 + 10, 2 + 10 + 20, 2 + 10 + 20 + 40, 2 + 10 + 20 + 40 + 70, and so on. The next term would be 2 + 10 + 20 + 40 + 70 + 140 = 262. But this is not an option. Looking at the options again, the correct answer is A) 252, which is 2 + 10 + 20 + 40 + 70 + 70. This is the closest available option, although not the exact answer. However, the correct next term in the series is not among the options, but option A) 252 is the closest available answer.'}\n",
      "{'answer': 'B', 'reasoning': \"Let's break down the information given. Ravi's father has a brother, and that brother's daughter is the sister-in-law of Ravi's mother's only brother's son. This implies that Ravi's mother is the sister of the brother of the son. Since the son is the brother of Ravi's mother's brother, the son is Ravi's first cousin. Therefore, Ravi is the first cousin of the son of Ravi's mother's only brother.\"}\n",
      "{'answer': 'A', 'reasoning': \"O is the daughter of N and P. Since N is the brother of M and M is the father of L, making L the child of N's sibling. As G is the brother of F and F is the parent of D, making D the grandchild of N's sibling. Given that A is the child of B and C, and C is the sibling of G, making A the grandchild of N's sibling. Therefore, O is the first cousin of A.\"}\n",
      "{'answer': 'C', 'reasoning': \"Let's break down the relationships: Ravi is the son of Ramesh's sister, making Ravi the nephew of Ramesh. Ramesh's father is the brother of Lata's mother, making Ramesh the uncle of Lata. Since Lata is the daughter of Ramesh's paternal aunt, Lata is the niece of Ramesh. Therefore, Ravi is the nephew of Ramesh's niece Lata, making Lata Ravi's niece.\"}\n",
      "{'answer': 'A', 'reasoning': 'The given series appears to be formed by adding 1, 3, 9, 15, 27,... to the previous term. This pattern suggests that each term is increasing by consecutive squares (1^2, 3^2, 3^2 + 6^2, 3^2 + 6^2 + 9^2, 3^2 + 6^2 + 9^2 + 12^2,...). Following this pattern, the next term would be 3^2 + 6^2 + 9^2 + 12^2 + 15^2 = 3^2 + 6^2 + 9^2 + 12^2 + 15^2 = 372'}\n",
      "{'answer': 'C', 'reasoning': \"Let's break down the information: Anaya's paternal grandmother's only son is the brother of Anaya's maternal uncle's only daughter. This means Anaya's maternal uncle is the brother of Anaya's paternal grandmother's only son. Anaya's maternal grandfather's only daughter is married to the son of Anaya's paternal aunt's only brother. Since Anaya's maternal grandfather's only daughter is married to the son of Anaya's paternal aunt's only brother, Anaya's paternal aunt's only brother is Anaya's maternal uncle's son. Therefore, Anaya is the niece of Anaya's paternal aunt's only brother, making Anaya the niece of the son of Anaya's paternal aunt's only brother, which makes Anaya the niece of Anaya's paternal aunt's only brother's son, or the niece of the son of Anaya's paternal aunt's only brother, or simply the niece of the son of Anaya's paternal aunt's only brother, or the niece of Anaya's paternal aunt's only brother's son, which is the same as saying Anaya is the niece of Anaya's paternal aunt's only brother's son. Anaya is not the brother, cousin, or uncle of the son of Anaya's paternal aunt's only brother. Therefore, Anaya is the niece of the son of Anaya's paternal aunt's only brother.\"}\n",
      "{'answer': 'C', 'reasoning': 'Start by tracing the family relationships from H to A. H is the daughter of G, G is the daughter of F, F is the daughter of E, E is the son of D, D is the brother of C, and C is the parent of A. This forms a chain of relationships: H -> G -> F -> E -> D -> C -> A. Since C is the parent of A, H is the niece of A.'}\n",
      "{'answer': 'C', 'reasoning': \"Given the relationships, we can deduce that B is the sister of C. Since J is the brother-in-law of A, and A is the father of B, J must be the brother of B's mother. As E is the mother of F, and G is the brother of F, G is the brother of B's mother. Therefore, G is the uncle of B. Since J is the brother of B's mother, J is the uncle of B.\"}\n",
      "{'answer': 'A', 'reasoning': \"Ravi is the son of Suman's only sister. Suman's father is the brother of Ravi's mother's father. This implies that Suman's father is the brother of Ravi's paternal grandfather. Since Ravi's mother is the daughter of Ravi's paternal grandfather, Suman is Ravi's maternal aunt. Therefore, Ravi is her nephew. The correct answer is A) Brother is incorrect because Ravi is not Suman's brother. The correct relationship is that of a nephew, making option A the correct answer.\"}\n",

Then, we find that X is the son of W and Y is the daughter of W. Therefore, Y is the daughter of X. Since X is the father of Y, X is the grandfather of Y. We continue this pattern and find that A is the son of Z and Z is the mother of A. Therefore, A is the son of Z, making A the nephew of Y, and since Y is the daughter of W, A is the nephew of W. Hence, A is a cousin of V, who is the daughter of W, making A a cousin of V.'}\n",
