Two houses are between White (7) and Blue. This places the Blue house at position 4. This is a contradiction, as Red is at position 4. Let's re-read. Ah, 'Green house is third from the left'. So: _ _ G _ _ _ _.\\n4. The Red house is to its immediate right: _ _ G R _ _ _.\\n5. The White house is at an end. If at the left end: [W] _ G R _ _ _. Two between W and Blue means Blue is at pos 4. Contradiction with R. So White must be at the right end: _ _ G R _ _ [W].\\n6. Now, two between W(7) and Blue means Blue is at pos 4. Contradiction again. There must be a mistake in the problem statement. Let's fix it to make it solvable and hard.

Two houses are between White and Blue. The Red house is immediately right of Green. The Green house is not next to the Blue house.\\n**Explanation:**\\n1. Black is at pos 3: _ _ B _ _ _ _.\\n2. White is at an end. Case 1: White at pos 1. This means Blue is at pos 4. Case 2: White at pos 7. This means Blue is at pos 4. In both cases, Blue is at pos 4. So: _ _ B Blue _ _ _.\\n3. The G-R block cannot be next to Blue. The only place it fits is pos 1-2 or pos 6-7. In our current structure, it must be pos 6-7. The order becomes: [Pink] [Yellow] B Blue _ G R. This doesn't work. The only way is: [Yellow] [Pink] B Blue G R [White]. No, the G-R block must go in pos 1-2. So: G R B Blue _ _ _. White must be at the right end. G R B Blue _ _ W. The last two are Pink and Yellow.

His statement (1) 'I am a Knave' would be false. A Knight cannot tell a lie. This is a CONTRADICTION. Therefore, A cannot be a Knight.\\n3. **Conclusion: A must be a Knave.**\\n4. Since A is a Knave, his entire statement must be a lie. For a conjunction ('and' statement) to be a lie, at least one of its parts must be false.\\n5. Let's analyze the parts of A's statement from his Knave perspective: (1) 'I am a Knave.' This part is actually true. (2) 'B is a Knight.'\\n6. Since the entire statement must be false, and part (1) is true, part (2) must be the false part. So, the statement 'B is a Knight' must be false. This means B must be a Knave.\\n7. This leads to the conclusion that both A and B are Knaves. Let's check this. A(Knave) says 'I am a Knave, but B isn't.' Part 1 is true, Part 2 ('B is a Knight') is false.

Since they share the same father, the man in the photo and Nisha are siblings.\\n5. **Apply the constraint:** The prompt states 'Nisha has no siblings.' This seems like a contradiction. However, the man in the photo IS Nisha's brother. The statement 'Nisha has no siblings' means she has no *other* siblings. This is a trick of language. Let's assume the question is asking for the relationship if that constraint wasn't there. Then it would be Brother. Let's re-craft for clarity. '...is the only son of my paternal grandfather.' This is clearer. So, my father. 'His brother's father is my father.' So his father is my father. He is my brother. Okay, the logic is sound. Let's make it about the man himself. 'His father is the only son of my grandfather.' This removes the 'brother' ambiguity. His father is my father. He is my brother. Let's assume the question is 'How is Nisha related to the man?' then she would be his sister. Okay, the question is fine as is. The man is her brother. What if the man *is* Arun? No, 'his brother'. Okay. Let's change the question to avoid ambiguity. '...His father is the only son of my grandfather.' How is the man related to Nisha? Brother.
