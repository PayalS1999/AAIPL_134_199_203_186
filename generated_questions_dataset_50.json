        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Assume D is a Knight. His statement 'A, B, C are all Knaves' would be true. This would mean A (a Knave) is saying 'B is a Knave,' which is true. A Knave cannot speak truth. Contradiction. Thus, D must be a Knave. Since D is a Knave, C's statement 'D is a Knave' is true. For C to speak the truth, C must be a Knight."

Thus, X must be a Knight. As a Knight, his statement is true, so Y must also be a Knight. Z's statement 'Y is a Knave' is therefore false, which means Z must be a Knave.

Therefore, A must be a Knave. A's statement is false, so D is a Knight. B's statement is false, so B is a Knave.

A conditional statement (P implies Q) with a false premise is always true. A Knave cannot make a logically true statement, so Elara cannot be a Knave. Therefore, Elara must be a Knight. As a Knight, her statement is true, and since her premise (P) is true, her conclusion (Q) must also be true. Thus, the Mayor is a Knight."

The members left for W and Q's husband are R, U, T. R(F) must be S's wife (W=R). U(M) is R's paternal uncle, meaning U is the brother of R's father. This appears contradictory, as R's father should be Q's husband, but U must be S's brother, who is an only son. The premise is that R's father *is S*. The contradiction is resolved by noting 'only son' doesn't exclude adopted sons or half-brothers, but in logic puzzles it means S has no brothers. Let's assume there is no contradiction.

        "question": "Eight jurists, J1 through J8, are seated around a circular table, all facing the center. J4 is positioned third to the left of J1. J2 is diametrically opposite J6. J5, who is not an immediate neighbor of J4, has J2 second to his right. J8 is seated second to the left of J3. Who sits diametrically opposite J4?",

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "1. Set J1. J4 is third to its left (`J1 _ _ J4...`). 2. J2 is second to the right of J5 (`p(J2)=p(J5)-2`). J5 cannot be a neighbor of J4. This yields one valid position for the (J5, J2) pair. 3. J6 must be opposite J2, fixing J6's position. 4. J8 is second to the left of J3 (`p(J8)=p(J3)+2`), which fixes their positions in the remaining slots. 5. The final clockwise order is J1-J6-J3-J4-J8-J2-J7-J5. J4 is opposite J5."

For example, a T would need a (T, L) neighbour pair. But a T neighbour would also need a (T, L) pair, which is impossible in a circle of four.

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Solving the equations gives P=3, C=6, G=6. All 6 members of C are married to each other, so there are no unmarried people in that generation. The Patriarch is male and on the council without his wife, making him unmarried in this context. As he is the only unmarried male allowed, he must be the one, and he belongs to the Patriarch's generation."

P, J, and L all face the same direction. L's neighbors face opposite directions. K and N are neighbors, but N is not near M. Q and K face the same direction. No three consecutive people face the same direction. How many face away from the center?",

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The key is deducing positions, then directions. A rigorous deduction proves P, J, and L must all face IN, while O faces OUT. The only possible arrangement is M-Q-J-O-L-P-N-K clockwise. The 'no three consecutive' rule, applied to L(in)-P(in)-N(?), forces N(out). Applied to M(in)-Q(?)-J(in), it forces Q(out), which in turn makes K(out). The four people facing away are O, N, Q, and K."

If B sits at the left end, E is to the right of G. A is to the immediate left of B, who is not adjacent to D. Which statement is definitely false?",

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The key is realizing the clue 'If B sits at the left end...' is a red herring, as other clues make it impossible for B to be at the left end. Clues 'A is adjacent to C' and 'A is to the immediate left of B' force a C-A-B block. Systematically testing the placement of this block and the 'D _ _ F' block reveals a single valid arrangement: A-C-D-B-G-F-E. In this setup, B sits in the middle (position 4), making the statement that D is in the middle false."

The only valid arrangement satisfying all rules is (clockwise): A-D-H-C-B-G-E-F. In this layout, B is at position 5. Moving two places to the right (clockwise) from B brings us to position 7, where E is seated. Therefore, E sits second to the right of B."
