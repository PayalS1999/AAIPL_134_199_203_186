K is L's son-in-law and is married to L's daughter. Given the family structure, K must be N's husband. 5. This makes L a parent of N, so L must be O or P. 6. J is the son of N.

This is consistent with Y (Knave) falsely claiming 'X is a Knave.' Now check Y's statement. A Knave saying 'X is a Knave' is a lie, so X is a Knight. This is consistent. Let's retrace. Ah, I'm describing the correct chain. The key is to first assume X is a Knight and follow the implications. This leads to a consistent solution where X is the Knight. Let me recheck. If X is a Knight, Y is a Knave. This works. If X is a Knave, his implication is irrelevant. Y's statement must be true, making Y a Knight. This also works. There are two consistent solutions. The premise must be revised. Let's build a solvable one: X says 'Y is a Knave.' Y says 'I am a Knave.' Both cannot be Knights. Assume X is a Knight. Y is a Knave. This works. Assume Y is a Knight. X is a Knave. This also works. The key is to realize the speaker's identity determines the truth value of their statement."
