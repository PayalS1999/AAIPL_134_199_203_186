Similarly, B's statement that 'C is a Knave' is false, so C is a Knight, but this contradicts D's claim. However, if D is a Knave, then his statement is false, meaning not all of A, B, and C are Knaves. This allows for a consistent scenario where D is a Knave and at least one of A, B, or C is a Knight. The only consistent scenario is if D is a Knight and A, B, and C are Knaves."

However, if she is a Knave, her statement is false, meaning the implication is false. For an implication to be false, the antecedent must be true and the consequent false. Thus, if Elara is a Knave, she is a Knave (antecedent true) and the Mayor is a Knave (consequent false), making the statement false. Therefore, Elara must be a Knave."
