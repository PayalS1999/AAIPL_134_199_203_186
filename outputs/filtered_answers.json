His statement is false, so X is a Knight. This is also a contradiction. The scenario leads to a paradox, making it impossible."

        "reasoning": "The speaker is a male. His mother's only son must be him. His father's only nephew must also be him. The contradiction implies the speaker has no father. The daughter is his niece, as her parent-child relationship is not defined by the same parent as the speaker's mother."

        "reasoning": "The woman has no siblings, so 'my father's only child' refers to herself. The man is her father's only son, making him her brother. The lack of siblings clarifies that the 'only son' is not her father's child, but a separate individual, establishing a direct sibling relationship."

If B is the Knight, C's statement 'B is a Knave' would be true, another contradiction. Thus, C must be the Knight, and A/B are Knaves. C's statement 'B is a Knave' is true, consistent with C being a Knight."

Q must be on North, leaving S on South. This means U is on North with Q and S, and V and T are on South."

Q's statement 'R is a Knave' is a lie, so R is a Knight. This is a contradiction. Assume S is a Knight. Then 'P is a Knave iff I am a Knave' is true, so P is a Knave. This leads to no contradictions.
